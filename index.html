This paper explores dark matter and its effect on gravitational lensing, highlighting key discoveries and applications.
The 30.1% of dark matter suggested to be in our universe was first hypothesised by Fritz Zwicky but their theory was
later confirmed by Vern Rubin in the 1970s as she observed the velocities of stars and how their motion did not match
the quantity of visible matter. Gravitational lensing occurs when light is deflected due to the mass of a large celestial 
object, for example, a star. There are three types of gravitational lensing - strong, weak and microlensing, which could
be used to produce large-scale maps of the universe's structure.

Dark matter is defined as a component of the universe whose presence is discerned from its gravitational attraction rather
than its luminosity. It is said that 30.1% of the universe comprises matter-energy composition. (Riess 2024)  It is 
characterised by a lack of interaction with electromagnetic force hence, it does not absorb, reflect or emit light.
(CERN, no date). However, research shows that dark matter halo has non-negligible effects on gravitational lensing 
(Qiao and Su 2024). Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object‚Äôs gravity redirects light
making it appear distorted. There are currently three main types of gravitational lensing, strong lensing, weak lensing
and microlensing(University of California, 2010) Dark matter was first discovered in 1933 by Swiss American Fritz Zwicky 
and confirmed by Vera Rubin (American astronomer) in the 1970s. The Standard Model for dark dark matter suggests the existence
of a ‚Äòhidden valley‚Äô which is the existence of a parallel universe. (NASA, no data)

What is the current understanding of Dark Matter?

Discovery and Proof of Dark Matter:

In 1933, Fritz Zwicky studied the ‚ÄôComa Cluster‚Äô which is made up of upwards of thousands of galaxies, approx 330 million light years away.
During his studies, Zwicky observed that the galaxies were moving too fast in a cluster compared to the visible mass thus concluding that
there was not enough mass to hold the cluster together. To determine why there is a missing mass, Zwicky measured the predictable brightness
of a known star, an observation known as the standard candle and compared that value to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (see Figure 1.)

     //FIGURE 1// 
      
Since light obeys the inverse square law, Zwicky was able to estimate the mass of the stars in the galaxy based on the overall brightness 
of the galaxy. However, to figure out the speed the observed galaxy was moving at, Fritz Zwicky needed to apply the ‚ÄòDoppler Redshift Effect‚Äô- 
the Doppler effect describes how the relative motion of the source and the sensor alters the frequency of electromagnetic or sound waves
(Jonathan D. Kaunitz, 2016) - to calculate the change in wavelength of light emitted by the galaxy. Since the clusters move freely under gravity, 
Fritz Zwicky applied the Virial Theorem which results in this equation, m=v2rG. However, Zwicky‚Äôs calculated mass was not equal to the mass of
visible matter, concluding that there must be invisible matter (dark matter). Almost 40 years later, Vera Rubin was researching the motion of
galaxies expecting that when the radius from the centre increased, the velocity of stars would decrease mv2r=GMmr2 so, v2= GMr,so where m is the 
mass of the observed star, v is velocity, M is the mass of the galaxy and G is the gravitational constant, however, the data Vera Rubin plotted (figure 2.) 

      //FIGURE 2//
      
showed that the velocity is constant at the outer rim of the galaxy. Since mass(m) is proportional to the radius (r) of the space, the greater r is 
the more enclosed mass there is in a given volume yet, this contradicted all theories at the time as there wasn‚Äôt enough luminous matter to each
mass required for the observed velocity. Even with the technological advancements in telescopes which allowed astronomers to observe dust and gas, 
its mass still didn't come close to the mass required to keep the stars at such velocities, thus the conclusion that there is an invisible matter
that does not reflect nor absorb light hence not visible to the human eye or optical telescope, therefore, preventing the stars from flying off 
their orbits and into the cosmos. 

What is Gravitational Lensing and What are the uses of Gravitational Lensing?

Gravitational Lensing 
Wambsganss (1998) suggested that gravitational lensing shows many attractive features as an academic discipline as its principles are easy to 
understand and explain as it follows geometrical effects. The first written account of light deflection due to gravity in ‚ÄúBerlin Astronomical 
Yearbook for the Year 1804‚Äù in an article titled ‚ÄúOn the Deflection of a Light Ray from its Straight Motion due to the Attraction of a World Body 
which it Passes Closely‚Äù written from Johann Georg von Soldner who explored this effect and inferred the light ray deflection, ùõº,  is close 
to the solar limb, which are the cooler layers of the sun that produce the least visible light, at ùõº= 0.84 arcsec. In 1919, Einstein obtained the 
value ùõº= 0.83 arcsec using Newtonian Physics, which the predicted value was later confirmed to be more than accurate to 0.02%.   

Uses of Gravitational Lensing in Astronomy
Arguably, weak gravitational lensing could be used to map out the outskirts of large galaxy clusters and trace the large-scale structures due to
their effect on other galaxies. Currently, this method faces the challenge of being unable to differentiate between the different sources of redshifts.
However, once this challenge is overcome, it will be possible to produce a three-dimensional map of matter in the universe rather than the current light 
map. Thus providing the most understating of structure formation and evolution alongside determining the content of the universe matter. Alternatively,
the basic derivations of the gravitational lens equation done by Sjur Refsdal showed how the gravitational lens effect could be used to determine Hubble‚Äôs 
constant by measuring the time delay between two lensed images. In addition, another use might be as a strong magnifying lens which would boost the amount 
of studies into the early evolutionary stage, with the earliest possible stage being infant or proto-galaxies relatively short after the big bang. 

Summary:
In summary, dark matter contributes 30.1% of the universe‚Äôs matter-energy which only interacts with gravity thus making it invisible.The initial discovery 
of dark matter in 1933 by Fritz Zwicky which was later confirmed by Vera Rubin in the 1970s led to further research into gravitational lensing and its uses
including determining Hubble‚Äôs constant. However, there are still challenges remaining that could provide a better understanding of our universe.
